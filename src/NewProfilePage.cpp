<cr>How to become a Geometry Dash Moderator?</c>

Many community members want to become a <cl>Moderator</c> to be able to suggest levels for a rating. Similar to rating, Moderator promotions are solely done by <cj>RobTop</c> himself on a case-by-case basis, so there are no clear steps to getting it. Here are some general criteria:
<cg>- Be nice.</c>
<cg>- Be active in the community.</c>
<cg>- Be trustworthy.</c>
<cg>- Be able to judge levels well.</c>

If you display these qualities over time, there is a chance that <cy>other Moderators</c> may suggest you to <cj>RobTop</c>. Of course, showing that you are qualified may be difficult if you do not share circles with pre-existing Moderators. If you are interested, you can apply to join the team using our application form. Make sure you read the information in it clearly before submitting. Here is the link:
